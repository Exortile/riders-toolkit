# Riders Toolkit

A toolkit designed to interface with many facets of the GameCube version of Sonic Riders. This project aims to integrate a lot of the different tools needed to modify game files (textures, texture archives, encoded text files, game archives, etc) into a single, centralized application, alongside a graphical user interface. This should make the workflow of working with the game a little bit more painless and less tedious.

**NOTE: This is currently in active development and most features aren't fully usable yet.**

## Planned features

- [x] **Texture Archives**
  - Currently pretty functional. There's a plan to integrate in-place GVR texture encoding so you don't have to do it yourself.
- [ ] **Graphical Archives**
- [ ] **PackMan Archives**
  - Nearly done. Almost functional, but missing a couple key features to make it fully usable.
- [ ] **Text Files**
